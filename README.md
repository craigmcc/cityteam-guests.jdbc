## CityTeam Application for Overnight Guest Registration

This application supports the ability for a CityTeam facility to register
overnight guests, as well as track overall statistics about their usage of
the facility.

This application is based on Tomcat plus JDBC plus relevant support libraries,
so it should only require presence of a relevant database and the customatization
of the Tomcat configuration to include an appropriate data source configuration
for that database.
